# 🧠 FeelAI – Emotion-Aware Conversational Agent

## ✨ Project Name: *FeelAI* (temporary placeholder)

---

## 🧭 Purpose

**FeelAI** is an AI-powered conversational agent designed to offer emotional support through natural, empathetic dialogue.  
Its goal is not to replace professional therapy, but to provide **a safe and judgment-free space** where users can express emotions, explore thoughts, and receive tailored, realistic guidance.

> “You're not broken. You're human. And it's okay to feel what you're feeling.”

---

## 🌱 Project Philosophy

- **No judgment**: Emotions—whether mild or intense—are always welcome.
- **No magic cures**: We don’t promise instant healing. We offer space, clarity, and orientation.
- **Tech as a mirror**: AI isn’t used as a replacement for human connection, but as a reflective tool to help users understand themselves better.
- **Right words for the right person**: Guidance is adapted to age, tone, emotional depth, and cultural context.

## 🧰 Core Features (Planned MVP)

- 💬 **Conversational interface** (chat-based to start)
- 🧠 **Emotion & sentiment analysis** (based on NLP tone, language, expression)
- 🪞 **Emotional validation & feedback**: “It sounds like you’re feeling…”
- 🧭 **Micro-guidance**:
  - Suggest breathing/grounding exercises
  - Suggest journaling prompts
  - Offer reframing questions or supportive quotes
- 🚨 **Crisis detection**:
  - If critical mental distress is detected, the agent redirects users toward professional resources or emergency hotlines (region-specific).
- 🧩 **User profiling via conversation**:
  - No interrogation-style forms. The agent adapts naturally to tone, age, vocabulary, and expressed needs.

## 🔮 Future (V2+)

- 🎙️ **Voice-to-voice interaction** (speech-to-text + text-to-speech)
- 🔊 **Tone-of-voice emotional analysis** (prosodic emotion detection)
- 🧑‍🎨 **Custom personas**: “Do you want someone to just listen, to help you reflect, or to cheer you up?”
- 🌐 **Multilingual support**
- 🪪 **Secure user profile memory** (opt-in): track long-term emotional journey (with full control over privacy)

---

## 🔐 Ethical Commitments

- **Transparency**: Users are informed this is not a therapist or human.
- **Privacy-first**: All data is anonymous by default. No emotional profiling is sold or shared.
- **Referral over ego**: If the agent detects critical distress, it doesn’t attempt to solve it—it guides toward human help.
